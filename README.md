# Discord

Discord bot chat, !ducky commands, and agent server-admin tools in UEFN Ducky.

Desktop plugin for [UEFN-Ducky](https://github.com/UEFN-Ducky/UEFN-Ducky) (`discord`).
Owns its full backend (`bots` / `client` / `poller` / `presence` / `commands` / MCP tools)
and Phase-2 HTML UI (`ui/settings.html`, `ui/chat.html`).

Install or update from **Settings → Store** in the app — do not install from a zip by hand.

For a full member list and Online/Offline status, enable **Server Members Intent** and
**Presence Intent** on the bot in the Discord Developer Portal (Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents).

**Job webhook:** Settings → Discord → “Notify when a ducky finishes”. Paste a Discord
Incoming Webhook URL (channel Integrations — not a bot token). When a chat in the
Ducky app ends a job (`agent_stopped` done/error/timeout), the plugin POSTs to that URL.

This plugin is a **real Discord bot** (Gateway `MESSAGE_CREATE`) — not a REST poller.
**Show offline** disconnects the gateway (bot appears Offline; no `!commands` until Online again).
Enable **Message Content Intent** in the Dev Portal if gateway content is empty (we also hydrate via REST).

## Build

```bash
py scripts/build_zip.py
```

Writes `deploy/discord-<version>.ducky-plugin.zip` (scripts/ and deploy/ are not packed).

## Secrets

Never commit tokens or keys. The app stores `discord`, `discord_guild`, `discord_name`, `discord_allowed_ids`, `discord_channel` (and per-bot `discord:<id>`) locally (DPAPI), not in this package.
